    <h1>Comparing socioeconomic score, study hours, sleep hours, attendance and grades</h1>
    <p>My chosen data set displays data on the amount of sleep a person gets, the amount of hours they study for, their attendance record, and their grade as a result. I chose to investigate this topic because it applies to me and my age group as studying is a very impactful part of our daily lives. The amount we do determines how well weâ€™ll do in the exams to come and school in general.</p>
